# A graph-based superpixel segmentation method for measuring pressure ulcers

Monitoring wound healing is a necessary procedure to help the health services control pressure ulcers. In this paper, we present an effective method for ulcer delineation that uses graph-based superpixel segmentation as its main core. The computation of pressure ulcer measurements is performed through a pipeline composed of superpixel segmentation, superpixel feature extraction, classification, ulcer segmentation and feature description. The method outperformed five other state-of-the-art superpixel approaches, as well as deep learning models, reaching 92.6% of sensitivity, 98.6% of specificity, 97.6% of precision, 96.6% of accuracy, and 90.4% of intersection over union.
